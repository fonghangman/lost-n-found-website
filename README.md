# EXPLANATION OF OUR PROJECT
Our website is a lost-and-found item tracker for Kellett School. When students find any lost items, it can be thrown into lost-and-found bins placed in the senior school office (not done yet). There, the item will uploaded to the website in which students can reserve the items and claim them the next school day.
